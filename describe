Shell-Command-Describe tool

Usage:
  describe [shell command]

This debugging tool will parse the shell command, then reconstruct the
string description of the command.

The input and output should be very similar, or it might indicate a bug
in the parsing/iterating code.

Example:
    $ ./describe 'seq 1 10 | wc -l && echo ok'
    -- Input Command:
    seq 1 10 | wc -l && echo ok
    -- Command Description (after parsing):
    seq 1 10 | wc -l && echo ok

To see the syntax-JSON-structure, use the 'parse' tool.
